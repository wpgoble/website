## Syllabus statement on Accommodating Students with Disabilities
Dickinson values diverse types of learners and is committed to ensuring that 
each student is afforded equitable access to participate in all learning 
experiences. If you have (or think you may have) a learning difference or a 
disability – including a mental health, medical, or physical impairment – that 
would hinder your access to learning or demonstrating knowledge in this class, 
please contact Access and Disability Services (ADS). They will confidentially 
explain the accommodation request process and the type of documentation that 
Dean and Director Marni Jones will need to determine your eligibility for 
reasonable accommodations. To learn more about available supports, go to 
[www.dickinson.edu/ADS][website1], email access@dickinson.edu, call 
(717)245-1734, or go to the ADS office in Room 005 of Old West, Lower Level 
(aka "the OWLL"). If you’ve already been granted accommodations at Dickinson, 
please follow the guidance at [www.dickinson.edu/AccessPlan][website2] for 
disclosing the accommodations for which you are eligible and scheduling a 
meeting with me as soon as possible so that we can discuss your accommodations 
and finalize your Access Plan. If you will be using any test-taking 
accommodations in this class, be sure to enter all test dates into your 
Access Plan in advance of our meeting.

## Physical access to my office (Tome 246) and classrooms

If there is ever a malfunction with the elevtor, I will gladly arrange 
to meet you at an altrnative location or by video conference.

All classrooms in which I teach are accessible by elevator. If there is 
ever a malfunction with the elevator, I will make all class material available
